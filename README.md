# ⛏️ **Go *Obreros*** - or *Workers* 🛠️

### **All *Obreros* in this project are given proper healthcare, and snacks at the office.**

##### 🚧 **This project is under construction** 🚧

###### Haha I'm so funny. 

## Useful Stuff 💡

 * To run this project, you need Go and Make installed, and also a MySQL DB to connect to.

 * This isn't meant to be deployed anywhere (at least for now), so no Dockerfile or anything like that.

 * Configure variables on `core/config.go` - Run **`make all`** after and just wait for it to start.

For more commands, check the `Makefile` 🌈
